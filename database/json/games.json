        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">NCSoft has been in the MMORPG space for years now, but ever since Lineage and Lineage II, the company hasn't hit it big on too many titles. Guild Wars 2 does well, but it that's more on ArenaNet than NCSoft. Fans have been waiting for \"Lineage III\" forever. After multiple false starts and restarts, Throne and Liberty has risen from the ashes of Lineage Eternal and aims to bring something new to MMOs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Featuring a focus on PvP, particularly between guilds, Throne and Liberty challenges players to band together into guilds to protect castles, take over delivery routes to claim taxes, and conquer other guilds on their server. You've likely seen advertisements for the game that include examples of siege warfare and vehicle combat all taking place surrounded by spell-slinging players in flashy displays of MMO goodness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That's not to say that Throne and Liberty is all about PvP, though. Amazon Games has worked with NCSoft to adapt the MMO slightly from its original Korean release. Making changes to PvE content, adding more things for PvE players to do, and adjusting the monetization, Amazon Games hopes to see Throne and Liberty's quasi-action combat and features land themselves with a large MMO audience.</p>",

Even crafting nodes are shareable; there's no competition for resources or other rewards.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guild Wars 2 offers several different types of gameplay. In addition to the open-world content, there's structured PvP, which pits teams of five players against each other, and World vs. World, a series of open-world PvP maps where players fight over castles and other fortified (and un-fortified) spots to bring their home world to victory. Characters are autoleveled to 80 in each case, so you can jump right in and start enjoying these parts of the game immediately (though the free-to-play version of the game does have its limitations).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ArenaNet is committed to a \"no grind\" philosophy for Guild Wars 2, in terms of gear progression. Top-tier stat gear is relatively easy to get, and the high-end gameplay typically revolves around acquiring new and different skins to customize your character's look, rather than to simply provide bigger stat bonuses. This applies to the expansions, too, which ArenaNet has said will never raise the level cap above 80, making the game easy to jump into for both new players and those who have come back to the game after a long absence.</p>",

Players will be able to claim land, build a house, gather resources, craft items which they can use or sell, and engage in Guild vs Guild or open world PVP. It is up to the player to decide how they want to interact with the world.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Classes are unique in that they are tied to gear. Any player can wear any piece of gear, so equipping a robe will allow the player the ability to use more powerful magic at the cost of defense. Equipping a sword and crossbow will give the player the freedom to engage in melee or ranged combat. There are quests to level your battle stats and open world PVP or Guild vs Guild also allow the player to earn experience. This is fairly important later on, as players must venture into dangerous PvP areas to harvest the most valuable resources.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Resources are abundant in the open world, but tiered based on how dangerous the location is. This means players must venture out and gather what they can. Gather too much though, and the player will begin to move slower due to the weight, making him an easy target for a rogue player or nearby mobs.</p>\n\nOnce back at camp, the resources can then be used to build items, -such as gear and weapons- which can be used or sold to other players. Non-instanced personal housing is also available and requires the player to gather a multitude of resources in order to complete crafting. Luckily, multiple players can contribute to building one structure. Houses give players more inventory storage, provide a respawn point, give character buffs and it provide a place to hang the spoils of victory. Guilds can even take over whole cities, claiming taxes from those who live within the city, but who must also defend them against other guilds in 20 vs. 20 battles.</p>",

Play as either a Gaurdian or a Defiant in your fight for control of the ever-changing planes of Telara, choosing from 40 unique souls to create your own custom class. Be careful though, Telara is plagued with dimensional rifts that can occur at any moment, offering brave warriors untold power, or unleashing invasions of extra-planar beings bent on destruction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> Rift's soul system is quite robust. Players can opt to use three souls at a time (although more can be used by switching specs) with each one contributing unique passives and active abilities to the player's character.  As a player puts more points into a singular soul, they unlock more abilities to utilize for that soul.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The MMO offers dynamic Rift events which spawn a variety of enemies in certain locations and usually require groups of players to to tackle. If players ignore these Rifts enemies will begin a crusade towards nearby towns, capturing them and preventing players from turning in quests or utilizing the hubs services. Players will then need to recapture the hub in order to regain control. Occasionally, large open world raid bosses will spawn from these Rifts which require a coordinated effort to tackle.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rift's endgame is quite expansive, boasting multiple dungeons and raids with up to 20 people. Players looking for more open world content can participate in instant adventures which party players together in raids and have them completing multi-stage quests sprawling across a zone. PvP is also available, with Rift offering multiple Warfronts and open world PvP to take part in. Each with their own innovative mechanics and rewards. </p>",

In this turn-based game, players initially meet their guides, some of the more popular One Piece characters, and set off to find Luffy. Players can then recruit additional One Piece characters in the game’s tavern, the goal being to form an effective, balanced team from a wide pool of characters.\n\nThe game begins at a character select screen that features four gender-locked classes: sailor, dark mage, sniper and doctor. The sailor is a swordsman and an expert in striking multiple enemies and once, and providing protection for himself and the rest of the crew. The dark mage uses element magic and hypnotism to attack and control opponents. She can also use her abilities to determine enemy weaknesses and enhance her own abilities. The sniper lacks defensive capabilities, but is an expert in firearms and can do massive damage to single enemies from great distances. The doctors is skilled at healing his team members and poisoning enemies.\n\nThe combat system is mostly automated, and offers a variety of PvP and PvE features including Elite Battles and Devil Oars. Elite Battles are activated based on character levels; the first starts at level 30. Players are rewarded based on their performance in the challenge. In Devil Oars, multiple players gather in the Thriller Bark Mansion to battle the Devil Oars together. Should they succeed, they are handsomely rewarded. Players can also complete certain tasks daily for a reward.",

Use the game’s unique non-target combat system and participate in the PvP that is a strong focus in Sphere III.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you play Sphere III you will quickly learn that the combat does not auto-aim for you. You will have to manually aim your attacks using the color-coded crosshairs on your screen to determine the best skills to use against your enemies. This is particularly difficult when you are participating in the PvP servers where player’s will move much more erratically than an AI opponent. Careful killing to many players though, the game’s Karma System will make you lose gold and even items if you get killed and have a low Karma.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you get bored with the thousands of quests that Sphere III offers you may decide to start participating in Castle Sieges. Castle Sieges offer you the chance to take over castle and make them your own. If you end up controlling at castle this is the best way to earn some of the greatest items in Sphere III.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sphere III: Enchanted World features a great non-target combat system that provides freedom of aiming, dynamically calculates the damage and allows a player to quickly pick an optimum attacking ability, offering players something to develop their skills with. You can also participate in Castle Sieges to earn the best items in the game and make your Karma go up or down while participating in the PvP.</p>",

Players have almost total freedom within the game right from the beginning (starting out in an Orc prison cell aside). If you’re not interested in battling fierce monsters or questing through the varied lands within the game, you are more than welcome to fight other players within the game world with all of the skills and items you possess.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But be warned! Your enemies are crafty as well, and they will not hesitate to pick up items and scrolls cast aside in order to defeat you. From the thieves of Rogue’s Den to skeletons of the Desert Tomb, enemies lie in wait all throughout Aberoth, waiting to challenge your skills.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps the greatest asset of Aberoth is that it plays well even on the lowest system. No software upgrades or downloads required to engage in this unrestricted MMORP world of magic and fantasy. There is always a quest to be completed and special events are announced regularly.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Escape the Orc Prison and begin your path to greatness within the realms of Aberoth!</p>",

On more rare occasions, players will gain a skill point used in class trees to augment their current abilities or gain new specialty ones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The world of Royal Quest is filled with more than 200 unique monsters, each of whom may be aligned with a particular element. These elements dictate what types of abilities they are susceptible to, meaning players looking to maximize their damage will need to use different skills depending on what type of enemy their fighting. Enemies who breathe fire will not take as much damage from a fireball, but a frostbolt will cool them down in a hurry.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to games like Ragnarok Online, special cards sometimes drop off enemies, which can then be socketed into gear and weaponry in order to add additional bonus effects.Later in the game, players can collect pets and compete in several PvP arenas, Battlegrounds, and Castle Sieges.</p>",

The game has in-depth match making and dating features where players can even get married.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lucent Heart distinctively combines its anime style with inspiration from the zodiac and greek mythology. When players develop their own characters, they don’t simply decide between a Warrior or Mage specialing in crafts or quests, the players’ entire adventure will be influenced by their zodiac star sign. Each day, Lucent Heart announces a horoscope prediction specific to every player, which foretells how their character’s abilities, such as their fortune in battle or love, will be affected. With the power of the zodiac influencing their quests, regardless how players approach the game, their destiny is not always in their own hands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like many online MMORPG’s, players travel the lands meeting new players. Some will become friends, some enemies, but Lucent Heart demands a little more than that. Invited by the love-god Cupid, players can be matched up by, amongst other things, compatible star signs. This match-making process brings together players from all backgrounds where lasting friendships, and sometimes love, can blossom. If love blooms even further, players can marry in-game with a full church wedding inviting all of their friends!</p>",

With more than 1,000 characters featured from seasons 1 through 5 of the Digimon anime, not only is it faithful to the series' art design, Digimon Masters closely follows a story that will satisfy both loyal fans of the series as well as welcoming new gamers to the Digital World.</p>",

        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dragon Nest is a free to play 3D fast paced action MMORPG published by Nexon with cute anime inspired graphics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dragon Nest features four cute classes that can be directed down various paths of customization. Play as the melee ranged Cleric, the blunt and forceful warrior, the dodgy and powerful sorceress, or the deadly and speedy archer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Targeting is becoming a thing of the past. Dragon Nest forces players to aim each strike to strike at your aims. Using a small cursor, you will line up magic, hammer swings, and arrows to puncture your enemies. The engine behind this game is intense and the acrobatics, quick moves, and smooth stream of offensive maneuvers you can link together in this game may surpass lots of MMORPGs when it comes to gameplay. Whether alone or with a group, wanting a cake walk or a controller throw inducing gauntlet, Dragon Nest has you covered. You can customize the dungeons to your liking, with rewards matching the effort put into them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dragon Nest takes their unique systems and puts them to the test in dazzling skill based PvP arenas, featuring up to 16 players at one time. They are auto-balanced by keeping track of a player’s skill to match them against similarly skilled players in the future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Dragon Nest, assuming the role of Heroes of the world of Lagendia, players seek an antidote to save the poisoned Goddess Altea. Facing countless dangers, including a landscape overrun by throngs of deadly dragons, the Heroes must call upon their strength, speed and cunning - and even discover ways to morph into dragons themselves - to defeat the mightiest of the dragons, protect the sacred territories and save Altea.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the game’s intense combat featuring combination and chain attacks to randomly changing dungeons and sporadically spawning monsters, players will be kept on their toes as they engage in non-stop exploration of the colorful Dragon Nest world.</p>",

Howard. In Age of Conan, players enter Hyboria with thousands of their friends and enemies to live, fight, and explore the dark and brutal world of King Conan. Originally released as a retail game, Age of Conan: Unchained was relaunched as a free to play title allowing anyone to freely roam the vast lands of Hyboria either as free players or premium subscribers with access to extra content.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Age of Conan has always been a Mature gaming experience, but going Unrated gives the development team freedom to stay even more true to the original works of Conan author Robert E. Howard, and use even more of the barbaric, brutal and sexy setting that is Howard’s Hyboria. At the time, it was also considered to be the first AAA MMORPG to carry an “M” rating from the ESRB.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Age of Conan: Unchained allows an unprecedented level of control over your character. Define your character’s look and feel from their looks. Age of Conan’s 12 classes include an array of interesting classes, from new ideas like the Bear Shaman and Herald of Xotli to new twists on old favorites like the Assassin and Ranger. The classes are set up across four archetypes: Priests, Mages, Rogues, and Soldiers. But only the four classes (Barbarian, Demonologist, Guardian and Priest of Mitra) are available for all free players.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Age of Conan’s combat system lets you take an active role in combat. Rather than pressing an auto-attack button, you actually control every chop, thrust, and swing of your weapon. The combat system also allows you to control your defense rather than relying on statistics alone, adjusting your defenses as your enemies attack, lending an element of skill to every encounter. Age of Conan also features a robust system for mounted combat, allowing you to charge to victory on powerful horses, deadly war rhinos, and even the mighty mammoth!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Free players can only make two characters by default, while Premium players get eight character slots. Returning customers get to keep the number of character slots they already had. Funcom is also introducing an in-game store to the game where both free players and premium subscribers can purchase exclusive content such as weaponry and mounts. Some of the instanced dungeon content will be completely free, and other will be accessed through new passes or expansion purchases. Free players may access the beginnings of raids and the raid equipment ladder, but they can’t complete tier 1 without switching to Premium access or purchasing entry to more raids. Also Free players may only ride the horses which require the Basic Riding skill by default.</p>",

        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Entropia Universe is free to play 3D Sci-Fi MMORPG with interesting economic and social features. MindArk’s virtual economy universe is known by many names depending on when you started playing the game and what planet was the key planet at the time. While the game is free-to-play and does have some typical MMORPG elements (combat, questing, looting, etc) the primary difference between Entropia Universe and other games is the linking of a real world currency exchange.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imagine this: you spend $10 USD to buy some in game currency. You then use that currency and your skills (like sweating monsters) to farm up items of value and triple your total in-game currency. Sounds familiar so far, right? Here’s where Entropia Universe differs though. You can exchange that in-game currency BACK into real world money whenever you want to do so at a fixed conversion rate. This means players can play their game, have some fun, and turn an actual real life profit if they work hard enough.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This primary economic mechanic had netted Entropia Universe some serious press as players buy and sell actual locations in game for hundreds of thousands of real life dollars. The game has also appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records earning titles multiple times for the most expensive virtual items ever sold.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In game, players aren’t really limited to classes. If you like combat, go for it. Want to be a surgeon? You can do that too. If you can find a way to earn money doing something, chances are that Entropia Universe will allow you to do it. If you’re looking for a slightly off the beaten path Sci-Fi MMO game and would like to take your chance at making some extra scratch, check out Entropia Universe.</p>",
